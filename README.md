# 👋 Hey — I’m Sri Manikanth Martha
Software developer & AI engineer. I build software that builds itself (sometimes).

**I teach machines to do the boring parts** — combining clean engineering, automation, and AI to turn messy data and complex logic into smooth, production-grade systems.

## 🔭 What I do right now
- Building reliable, scalable backend systems and AI-driven web experiences.  
- Focus: automation, agentic workflows, high-throughput data pipelines, and polished web UIs.  
- Open to SDE roles and collaborations.

## 🧰 Tech & Tools
**Languages:** C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL  
**Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, SWR  
**Backend / Infra:** Node.js, Express, Flask, FastAPI, Supabase, PostgreSQL, Redis, BullMQ  
**Data / ML:** Pandas, PySpark, NLP, TTS, model serving (Flask / FastAPI)  
**DevOps / Tools:** Docker, Git, Linux, Postman
